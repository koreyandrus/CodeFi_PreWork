## Class Goal - Select a Personal Project

1. Ask yourself these questions
   - What am I interested in?
   - What skills do I already have?
   - What is something that could add value to someone I love/care about?
2. Browse a list of available API's
3. Brainstorm 10-15 potential ideas (in under 5 minutes... yes... set a timer)
4. Choose one that resonates with you and scope out the projects main features
5. Send a message to us with your idea

All projects should CREATE, READ, UPDATE, and DELETE data in some fashion. You can find a list of [public API's here](https://github.com/public-api-lists/public-api-lists)
